## Moderating

If you are moderator in any of our projects:

- When new Issues/PRs are opened we should check if they are in the scope of the project. In case they aren't we should politely explain why, suggesting alternatives, and closing them.
- To have a better organization we should tag the Issues/PRs as they get created. Include a label for the type and the severity & occurrence *(in case of a bug)*.
- If some information is required to have a better context about the Issue/PR we should ask the developer for it.
- If the Issue/PR doesn't follow the *Coe of Conduct*. We should close the Issue/PR right away.
